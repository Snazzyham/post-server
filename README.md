A modified version of [markdown-to-api](https://github.com/Snazzyham/markdown-to-api) that looks for new posts in my [blog post repo](https://github.com/snazzyham/blog-posts) and serves them over an API. 

I'm currently using IFTTT to watch for changes to the blog post repo, and on every new commit, refresh the server. 

There must be a better way, but for now this works.
